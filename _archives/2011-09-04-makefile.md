For long we have been using the command `make` and `make install` to install applications from source packages in Linux. Also, the OpenGL tutorials use Makefile to compile its .cpp source codes, from which I've learned the Makefile is nothing special but the `cc` commands and options put into a file. Well, of course it is far more than that. Fortunately, I came across an article on make and Makefile in _LinuxJournal_. Now, it's time to look back. All the terminologies are from the article. I'll illustrate it in the form of comments, which is led by `#` in Makefile.

The first sample is from the OpenGL tutorial.


```bash
# variables as in any other programming languages
# they will be used in the rules
CC = g++                # g++ compiler for .cpp
CFLAGS = -Wall          # compiling flags: warning all
PROG = basics
SRCS = basics.c

# directives

ifeq ($(shell uname),Darwin)                   # if I run uname in my shell I will get Linux
  LIBS = -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT     # Darwin is for OS X, I guess
else                                           # thus, these libs will be used
  LIBS = -lGL -lGLU -lglut                     # otherwise, the OpenGL codes won't work
endif


# phony targets, "phony" means not genuine
# they are aliases here. Remember make install and make clean.
# install and clean are aliases.
# all is the default alias
# so make is identical to make all.
all: $(PROG)

# rule && commands

$(PROG):$(SRCS)                                # the format of a rule is target:dependency
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(PROG) $(SRCS) $(LIBS)   # commands must be led by a tab

clean:
  rm -f $(PROG)

```

Now, you see how it works out. Another example is from the author.

I will only highlight new concepts.

```bash
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -c -Wall                            # -c means do not link
LDFLAGS =                                    # linking flags
SOURCES = main.cpp hello.cpp factorial.cpp
# assign SOURCES to OBJECTS but replace all .cpp suffixes with .o
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES: .cpp = .o)              
EXECUTABLE = hello

all: $(SOURCES) $(EXECUTABLE)
$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECTS)

# $@ is a predefined variable which stands for the current target, hello in this case
$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@

# generic rule for suffixes
# the dependency suffix goes before the target suffix
.cpp.o:
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

# $< is another predefined variable evaluating to the components used to make the target
# .cpp here
```

I'll stop here although there are more like special targets, predefined variables and directives. They'll be covered when I'm able to write a more sophisticated Makefile myself. It's just exciting to know what's underlying and what options you may have.
