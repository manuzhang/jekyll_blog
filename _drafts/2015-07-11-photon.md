[Photon: Fault-tolerant and Scalable Joining of Continuous Data Streams](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/41318.pdf) 

> To provide real-time statistical data, we built a system, called Photon, that can relate a primary user event (e.g. a search query) with subsequent events (e.g. a click on an ad) within seconds of the occurrence of such events


### Challenges

Joining two streams are analogous to inner joining two tables in relation database (RDBMS). Nonetheless, in RDBMS, data are already loaded into the tables while streams are flowing in continusouly and endlessly.  Streams are usually joined within a bounded time window. Even with the window, the arrival time of the records with the same keys are are uncertain. An extreme case is that one of the stream records exceeds the window boundary.
