The first Kafka Summit conference took place on April 26, 2016. [Confluent blogs summarized the highlights](http://www.confluent.io/blog/log-compaction-kafka-summit-edition-may-2016). Here are the talks I like most         
 
   - [Leveraging Kafka for Big Data in Real Time Bidding, Analytics, ML & Campaign Management for Globally Distributed Data Flows](http://www.slideshare.net/helenaedelson/leveraging-kafka-for-big-data-in-real-time-bidding-analytics-ml-campaign-management-for-globally-distributed-data-flows) by Helena Edelson.
   - [Streaming SQL](http://www.slideshare.net/julianhyde/streaming-sql-61426712) by Julian Hyde.
   - [Securing Kafka](http://www.slideshare.net/ConfluentInc/securing-kafka) by Jun Rao.
   - [Introducing Kafka Streams: Large-scale Stream Processing with Kafka](http://www.slideshare.net/ConfluentInc/introducing-kafka-streams-largescale-stream-processing-with-kafka-neha-narkhede) by Neha Narkhede.
   
Now let's start our reading. 

### Streaming

* Last week, we saw [Why Apache Beam? A Google Perspective](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/05/why-apache-beam-a-google-perspective). This week let's look at [data Artisans perspective on their involvement in Apache Beam](http://data-artisans.com/why-apache-beam/).

* In [Streaming at Spark Summit East 2016](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/03/15/spark-summit.html), we talked about the upcoming Structured Streaming API in Spark 2.0.  Now [Spark 2.0 Technical Preview](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/11/spark-2-0-technical-preview-easier-faster-and-smarter.html) is available. They find a number of problems in adopting a single programming model integrating both batch and streaming data and 

   > The vision of Structured Streaming is to utilize the Catalyst optimizer to discover when it is possible to transparently turn a static program into an incremental execution that works on dynamic, infinite data (aka a stream).

### Scala 

* Li Haoyi explores how to make use of the type-safety of Scala to catch mistakes at compile time in [Strategic Scala Style: Practical Type Safety](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/StrategicScalaStylePracticalTypeSafety.html). His previous posts in the series are highly recommended
   - [Strategic Scala Style: Conciseness & Names
](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/StrategicScalaStyleConcisenessNames.html)
   - [Strategic Scala Style: Principle of Least Power
](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/StrategicScalaStylePrincipleofLeastPower.html)

* Daniel Westheide introduces his observation that 
   > People are using Option too often where their business logic clearly indicates they should use their own, custom ADT.

  in [When Option Is Not Good Enough
](http://danielwestheide.com/blog/2016/04/26/when-option-is-not-good-enough.html).

### Machine Learning

* Google [announced SyntaxNet, open sourcing the worldâ€™s most accurate parser](http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html). SyntaxNet is an open-source neural network framework implemented in TensorFlow that provides a foundation for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems.

### One more thing

I also read about two nice articles on non-volatile memory this week 

   * [NOVA: A Log-Structured File System for Hybrid Volatile/Non-Volatile Main Memories](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/06/nova-a-log-structured-file-system-for-hybrid-volatilenon-volatile-main-memories/)
   * [Non-volatile Storage](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2874238) from ACM Queue.

but I don't think I understand them well enough. Hence I'd like to differ them to a dedicated post. See you there.
