title: Shade with SBT III

In the last part of [Shade with SBT II](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/11/12/shading-2.html),

> One one more thing is `java.lang.VerifyError` exceptions are thrown by JVM after the change. The work-around is adding `-noverify` in the JVM options. I haven't yet found the root cause and the issue is logged at [GEARPUMP-236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEARPUMP-236).

> I have a feeling that there will be a third episode of our story with sbt shade.

Now, here is the third episode. (The issue was resolved two months ago but my procrastination has been getting worse these days)

My colleague [Karol](https://github.com/karol-brejna-i) found that the `java.lang.VerifyError` went away when forcing usage of asm 5.1. Thanks to his thorough investigation, I can just post his [findings](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEARPUMP-236?focusedCommentId=15866352&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15866352) here.

> As stated here: [https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/205#issuecomment-278287602](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/205#issuecomment-278287602) there is probably a problem with shading.

jarjar seems to be based on org.ow2.asm 5.0.4 ([https://github.com/pantsbuild/jarjar/blob/master/lib/BUILD](https://github.com/pantsbuild/jarjar/blob/master/lib/BUILD))

This was also [confirmed by another user of sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/205#issuecomment-279967557) and fixed in [sbt-assembly 0.14.4](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/releases/tag/v0.14.4), and followed by asm upgrade in other downstream projects.

* [Update ASM dependency pantsbuild/jarjar#26](https://github.com/pantsbuild/jarjar/issues/26)
* [BEAM-1492 Upgrade bytebuddy to 1.6.8 to jump past asm 5.0](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/2014)

Ok, should this be the final episode ? I'm afraid not. Remember there is still an open question, [sbt published maven file missing artifacts with multiple scopes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40526420/sbt-published-maven-file-missing-artifacts-with-multiple-scopes).
