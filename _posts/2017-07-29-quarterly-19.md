title: Quarterly Reading 0x13

I was writing this about two weeks ago, but the first section [Exactly-once in Kafka](http://manuzhang.github.io/2017/07/17/exactly-once-kafka.html) ended up as a full post. The topic has been keeping its momentum this week, 

* [Exactly-once or not, atomic broadcast is still impossible in Kafka – or anywhere](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/exactly-not-atomic-broadcast-still-impossible-kafka/)
* [Notes on Exactly-Once semantics in light of Kafka's 0.11 release](http://data.alishoker.com/2017/07/notes-on-exactly-once-semantics-in.html)
* [What does Kafka's exactly-once processing really mean?](https://softwaremill.com/what-kafka-exactly-once-really-means/)

but I will refrain myself from talking more since there is a lot to catch up.

### Releases

* Apache Beam [published first stable release 2.0.0](https://beam.apache.org/blog/2017/05/17/beam-first-stable-release.html). They went up directly from 0.6.0 to join [Cloud Dataflow 2.0 SDK](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/06/cloud-dataflow-20-sdk-goes-ga) which is based on Beam 2.0.0.
* Apache Storm community [released 1.0.4](http://storm.apache.org/2017/07/28/storm104-released.html), a maintenance release along the 1.0.x line. Note Storm also has a [1.1.x line with Streaming SQL and Kafka 0.10 support](http://storm.apache.org/2017/03/29/storm110-released.html). I guess they try to stick to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

  > 1.	MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  > 2.	MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  > 3.	PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

  The downside is now two minor versions have to be maintained for bug fixes. 

* Apache Flink has made the fourth major release [1.3.0](http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/06/01/release-1.3.0.html) shortly followed by bug-fix release [1.3.1](http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/06/23/release-1.3.1.html). Some notable new features are incremental checkpointing for RocksDB, side outputs, support for retractions in Table API/SQL. This is also a bug-fix version, [1.2.1](http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/04/26/release-1.2.1.html) for 1.2 series. In the future,

  > Users can expect Flink releases now in a 4 month cycle. At the beginning of the 1.3 release cycle, the community decided to follow a strict [time-based release model](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Time-based+releases). 
  
* Our Gearpump has also made a [bug-fix release, 0.8.4](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319920&version=12340225).

### Google Cloud Big Data

Google Cloud Big Data blog has a series of **After Lambda: Exactly-once processing in Cloud Dataflow**

* [Part 1 Learning the meaning of "Exactly-once" in Cloud Dataflow, its importance and implementation in Shuffle](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/05/after-lambda-exactly-once-processing-in-google-cloud-dataflow-part-1)
* [Part 2 Ensuring low latency with graph optimizations, bloom filters and garbage collection](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/05/after-lambda-exactly-once-processing-in-cloud-dataflow-part-2-ensuring-low-latency)
* [Part 3 Implementing sources and sinks for Exactly-once support](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/07/after-lambda-exactly-once-processing-in-cloud-dataflow-part-3-sources-and-sinks)

They also have announced 

* [Service-based shuffling which brings up to 5x performance improvements](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/06/introducing-cloud-dataflow-shuffle-for-up-to-5x-performance-improvement-in-data-analytic-pipelines)
* [Cloud Dataproc 1.2 ](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/07/cloud-dataproc-is-now-even-faster-and-easier-to-use-for-running-apache-spark-and-apache-hadoop), faster and easier to run Apache Spark (2.2.0) and Apache Hadoop (2.8.0).

### Java land

* With [Jigsaw finally completed](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=6016), Java 9 is around the corner (Sep. 21st). Azul blog has made a [summary of required changes when upgrading to Java 9](https://www.azul.com/jdk-9-pitfalls-for-the-unwary/).

* Wondering how to take advantage of Single Instruction, Multiple Data(SIMD) in Java ? [There is no way to use SIMD intrinsics in Java directly, as of Java 8](http://prestodb.rocks/code/simd/).

* Brendan Gregg has made a [Java Package Flame Graph](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-06-30/package-flame-graph.html) to visualize which package has taken up most CPU time.

* Kotlin is trending as [Android makes it an official language](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html). Why not Scala which also has [Android support](http://scala-android.org/) ? [This is how a Scala developer takes it by drawing an analogy to skiing](https://www.reactivesystems.eu/2017/05/21/java-scala-kotlin-skiing.html). 
    
That's it but I still have more than 50 articles in my Pocket(read-it-later App). "read-it-later" is actually becoming "never read". That has made me to start a new experiment, [read-it-now](https://github.com/manuzhang/read-it-now), to improve my reading quality.

> Rather than saving an article to Pocket to read it later, I’d like to read it now, take notes and put down my thoughts in a GitHub issue
