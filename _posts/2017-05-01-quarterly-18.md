title: Quarterly Reading 0x12
--- 

The weekly reading has been held off since Feb 27th, bypassing Biweekly, Monthly and finally to Quarterly. My Pocket list has been piling up (125 read-it-later) and I can no longer pretend the world doesn't change. It is revolving super fast. Unlike previous readings where we dived into technique details, we will look more from outside this time.

### Acquisition

While the big fish looks to fill in the missing part of its software stacks, the small fish seeks for sustainably growth and profit.   

* [Mozilla Acquires Pocket](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/27/mozilla-acquires-pocket/). Pocket started out as a Firefox add-on and finally has become part of it. Let's see how the integration could go deeper after the acquisition. 

* [Kaggle joins Google Cloud](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/welcome-Kaggle-to-Google-Cloud.html). 

  > Founded in 2010, Kaggle is home to the world's largest community of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.

  This could make deployment of machine learning algorithms much easier.
  
* [Gitter has been acquired by GitLab](http://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/). 

  > Next piece of wow: we will be open sourcing all of the Gitter. 
  
  Gitter will be like GitLab, which allows you to setup your own GitHub.  

### Business story

Another topic I rarely mention but is worth bringing up.

* [Why Trello Failed to Build a $1 Billion+ Business](https://producthabits.com/why-trello-failed-to-build-a-1-billion-business/)

  Actually Trello has more than 19M users and [was sold to Atlassian for $425M](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/atlassian-acquires-trello/), but it fell short in monetization and its main features were easily copy-catted. 
  
* [Intel, Mobileye, and Smiling Curves](https://stratechery.com/2017/intel-mobileye-and-smiling-curves/)

  A mind-blown post on [Intel's purchase of Mobileye](https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-to-buy-mobileye-for-15-3-billion-1489404970). The [smiling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiling_curve) is introduced to explain the value added by different players in the industry of PCs, Phones, Servers and future Cars, and thus the context of this purchase.


### Releases

* [Apache Gearpump(incubating)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319920&version=12338681) just released 0.8.3 with support for window DSL and finite stream.

* [Apache Beam 0.6.0](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319527&version=12339256) is available featuring, [Python SDK](https://beam.apache.org/blog/2017/03/16/python-sdk-release.html), [State API and Timer API support](https://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-sf-2017-kenneth-knowles-back-to-sessions-overview).

* [Storm reached a major of milestone, releasing 1.1.0](http://storm.apache.org/2017/03/29/storm110-released.html). Streaming SQL, PMML support, Kafka 0.10 / Druid / OpenTSDB and AWS Kinesis and HDFS support are all remarkable. 

* [Flink rolled out 1.1.5, a bugfix version of 1.1.0 series](http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/03/23/release-1.1.5.html).
 
### Road Ahead
 
 * [Five AI Startup Predictions for 2017](http://www.bradfordcross.com/blog/2017/3/3/five-ai-startup-predictions-for-2017) by Bradford Cross, who has been working with AI for nearly 20 years, and building silicon valley AI startups for nearly 10 (which leads to the fifth point).
 
     - Bots go bust.
       
       > the current mania around ‘bots’ defined as conversational interfaces over voice and chat will begin its collapse in 2017

     - Deep learning goes commodity
     
       > I am suggesting that deep learning will become more commodity among machine learning people this year, but i am not suggesting that machine learning itself will become commodity. 
       
     - AI is Cleantech 2.0 for VCs
      
       > the batch that are diving in at the top of this pre-mania are making the same mistake that cleantechs did -- they are diving into AI instead of diving into a customer need.
       
     - MLaaS dies a second death
     
       > the people that know what they’re doing just use open source, and the people that don’t will not get anything to work, ever, even with APIs
       
     - Full stack vertical AI startups actually work
    
       > Vertical AI startups solve full-stack industry problems that require subject matter expertise, unique data, and a product that uses AI to deliver its core value proposition.
