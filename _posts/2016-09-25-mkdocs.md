title: Rebuild Gearpump documentation with MkDocs
---

*(Disclamer: I am a committer of Apache Gearpump(incubator))*

## What's wrong with Jekyll 

[Apache Gearpump(incubating)](http://gearpump.apache.org/) website is currently built with Jekyll, the most popular [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/). Most of the contents are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) while Jekyll allows you to mix in HTMLs. With the default "Bootstrap" style theme, the website has a two-level top navigation bar. That is good for a general blog but not for documentations because the items are hidden in the pull-down menu and there is no table of contents for each page. First-time visitors won't know what to look for or which menu to click on. 

I prefer the "ReadTheDocs" style like [Confluent's Doc site](http://docs.confluent.io) where all the items are shown on the sidebar. If you click on one item, it will be collapsed into a multi-level table of contents and it's easy to go back and forth. I've been searching for such themes in Jekyll but the closest I've found is [Jekyll Doc Theme](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_sidebar_navigation.html). However, the table of contents of a page lies at the head of contents which I think is not convenient for navigation. Confluent's Doc site is built with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) and the sources are written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html). I didn't want to raise the bar for contributors by learning another markup language so I started to look for alternative generators that support Markdown. 

[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is by far the best answer with both Markdown sources and built-in "ReadTheDocs" theme. Then I started to rebuild documentations with MkDocs. It's not a smooth transition and I'd like to record the roadblocks.

## Roadblocks

### Global Variables 

We may have version numbers in the documentation here and there. For example,

```bash
### To run WordCount example
bin/gear app -jar examples/wordcount-2.11-0.8.1-assembly.jar org.apache.gearpump.streaming.examples.wordcount.WordCount
```

There are two version numbers here, scala version(2.11) and gearpump version(0.8.1). We don't want to hardcode the numbers which would mean updating all the numbers whenever a new version of Gearpump is released. We want variables. In Jekyll, we can define version numbers as [variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/) in configuration files. Unfortunately, MkDocs hasn't supported variables for Markdown source yet and the work is still [under discussion](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/304). 

In the discussion thread, someone shared a work-around where markdown sources are pre-processed with a template system like [mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) and variables will be replaced with corresponding values. The previous example is now written as

```bash
### To run WordCount example
bin/gear app -jar examples/wordcount-{{SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}-{{GEARPUMP_VERSION}}-assembly.jar org.apache.gearpump.streaming.examples.wordcount.WordCount
```

and the variables are defined in a yaml file

```yaml
---
GEARPUMP_VERSION: "0.8.2-SNAPSHOT"
SCALA_BINARY_VERSION: "2.11"
SCALA_VERSION: "2.11.8"
---
```

Also, I added scripts to copy documentations to a temporary directory and traverse down the directory pre-processing source with mustache. 

Finally, update `docs_dir` configuration from the default `docs` to `tmp` in `mkdocs.yml`.

```yaml
docs_dir: tmp
```

My first thought was to pre-process the HTMLs in `site` but they got overwritten when I run `mkdocs serve`.  

### Code Blocks

Existing code examples are written in fenced code blocks from [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/). MkDocs uses [Python Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) library to translate Markdown files into HTML. Python-Markdown has `fenced_code` extensions but there is a warning that

> Fenced Code Blocks are only supported at the document root level. Therefore, they cannot be nested inside lists or blockquotes.

A downside of markdown is many implementations do not enforce markdown syntax, for example, "each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab". This is enforced in Python-Markdown. 

For code blocks inside list, we indent by 8 spaces or two tabs and use `codehilite` extensions.

```
1. item1 

		:::scala
		# Code goes here ...

2. item2
3. item3
```

There is a [bug](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/issues/471) when using both `fenced_code` and `codehilite` extensions. Meanwhile I think it's better to stick to one style so I replaced all fenced code blocks with `codehilite` syntax. 

Remember to add the markdown extension in `mkdocs.yml`,

```yml
markdown_extensions:
    - codehilite:
        use_pygments: False
```

With Pygments highlights, a line of code will overflow if it is too long. Therefore I switched it off.

### Unsolved issues 

With the above roadblocks moved aside, there are still unsolved issues. 

* [Markdown tables expand beyond window with no scrollbar](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/834).
* tabs to switch between different language implementations of an example. (e.g. [self-contained-applications](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html#self-contained-applications) in Spark docs)

## Summary

Here is a comparison of documentations before and after the change.

![after](https://goo.gl/photos/xyDjEntAArq5mgzQA)

The details are at [https://github.com/apache/incubator-gearpump/pull/88](https://github.com/apache/incubator-gearpump/pull/88).

This seems a lot of work but I believe it's worth transiting to a doc style that helps users to learn Gearpump more easily.
