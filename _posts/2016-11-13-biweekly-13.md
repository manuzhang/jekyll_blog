title: Biweekly Reading 0xD
---

The biggest news for me in the past two weeks is the [US Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016). No, it's the release of [Scala 2.12](http://www.lightbend.com/blog/scala-2-12-released).

> The Scala 2.12 compiler has been completely overhauled to fully leverage the new VM features available in Java 8    
> ...    
> Code compiled on 2.12 requires a Java 8 runtime   
> ...    
> Scala 2.12 maintains source compatibility with 2.11, cross-building for both 2.11 and 2.12 is a one-line change to most sbt-based projects

The latest news is that Scala 2.12 would require jdk8u111 owing to a [JIT bug](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9828). 

Also in the news are the results for [Sort Benchmark Competition](http://sortbenchmark.org/) this year. Tencent won GraySort (44.8 TB/min) and MinuteSort (37TB in 60 seconds) with OpenPOWER systems while Alibaba lead CloudSort ($1.44/TB) with Haswell servers.

More on the hardware side, North Carolina researchers and Intel proposed to [use hardware queues to break the multi-core CPU bottleneck](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/238586-using-hardware-queues-break-multi-core-bottleneck). 

Now some nice readings for the past weeks.

* Adam Warski [looks at Windowing in Big Data Streams](https://softwaremill.com/windowing-in-big-data-streams-spark-flink-kafka-akka/) and how they've been supported in Spark Streaming, Flink, Kafka Streams and Akka Streams (Remember that Adam [manually implemented windowing](https://softwaremill.com/windowing-data-in-akka-streams/) for Akka).

* Jendrik Poloczek [released Mocked Streams to unit test Kafka Streams topologoies](https://www.madewithtea.com/released-mocked-streams-for-apache-kafka.html).

* Previously, we had an unsmooth experience through our journey of [Shade with SBT](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/10/15/shading.html). Someone even said [sbt makes me want to give up](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/5a6muj/sbt_makes_me_want_to_give_up_scala/) on Reddit. In the discussion, however, I found a nice article from Lightbend developer, James Roper, introducing [sbt, A task engine](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/10/15/shading.html).

* Do you know how much L3 cache read usually costs ? [An infographics estimates costs of certain operations in CPU clocks cycles](http://ithare.com/infographics-operation-costs-in-cpu-clock-cycles/) will help you to answer this question. This reminds me of [Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html).

* Bloomberg Beta has published [the current state of machine intelligence 3.0](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-current-state-of-machine-intelligence-3-0) with a crowded image including Technology Stack, Enterprise and Industries, and Autonomous Systems.

There are far more interesting materials from
