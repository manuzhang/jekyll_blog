Starting out this week, I'd like to share something different. It's [My Showdown with MJ](http://manuginobili.com/my-showdown-with-mj/) by my hero Manu Ginobili recollecting his only game with Michael Jordan, his childhood hero. I believe it's called inheritance. I've always been fascinated by Manu's passion, his magic and how he saved his team and fans from despair. I even named myself "Manu"!

Let's get back to technical session. 

### Streaming

* data Artisans guys [debunked six stream processing myths](http://data-artisans.com/stream-processing-myths-debunked/). These are long-time misconceptions on streaming people get from early versions of streaming systems.

  - There's no streaming without batch
  - Latency and Throughput: Choose One
  - Micro-batching means better throughput
  - Exactly once? Completely impossible
  - Streaming only applies to "real-time"

* Ever heard of [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) but wondering what it actually does? Let's get into [A Journey into Reactive Streams](https://medium.com/@kvnwbbr/a-journey-into-reactive-streams-5ee2a9cd7e29#.n8y4v6em0). Reactive Streams is a specification to solve stream processing problems and its implementations will be able to communicate via the Reactive Streams protocol.

### Scala

* Li haoyi [explored how old design patterns apply apply to Scala](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/OldDesignPatternsinScala.html). I like his definition of [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

	> A Design Pattern is something you do over and over when building software, but isn't concrete enough to be made into a helper method, class or other abstraction.
	
  In short, Scala has built-in support for some Java design patterns in the language to make your programming easier and less error-prone.
  
* Not all people buy in Scala or functional programming. [Disadvantages of purely functional programming](http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.jp/2016/05/disadvantages-of-purely-functional.html) threw cold water on it. Given my short experience with Scala, a impurely functional programming, it's true that some data structures are not efficient and sometimes [I got bitten by its laziness](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEARPUMP-249) but I will never go back to Java. In Java, after working out a solution, I spend extra time to figure out **how to implement it** while I can easily **express it** in Scala. I also like  **immutable** which reduces errors in my codes. 
  
* [Functions with more than 22 parameters are now automatically converted to functions taking a single object array parameter](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/1758).

* Akka is [using Aeron as the underlying transport in the new remoting implementation (codenamed Artery) for Actor messages](http://blog.akka.io/artery/2016/12/05/aeron-in-artery). It is based on UDP, providing the same guarantees as TCP but more efficient. 

	> Artery is designed from the ground up to support high-throughput in the magnitude of 1 million messages per second and low-latency in the magnitude of 100 microseconds.
  
### Java

* Plumber share their experiences on [the reasons why JVM crashes and where to look for evidence](https://plumbr.eu/blog/java/staying-on-top-of-the-jvm-crashes).

* Takipi [compare popular Java logging frameworks](http://blog.takipi.com/is-standard-java-logging-dead-log4j-vs-log4j2-vs-logback-vs-java-util-logging) from the logging statements used by GitHub's top Java projects.   
  
### Programming

From Martin Fowler's Bliki (Blog + Wiki)

* [How long should a function be?](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FunctionLength.html).

	> The argument that makes most sense to me, however, is the separation between intention and implementation.
	
* [Hidden precision can lead to some subtle bugs](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HiddenPrecision.html).

   > The more general conclusion is that floating point is tricksy when it comes to comparisons.
   
* [Aliasing bug occurs when the same memory location is accessed through more than one reference](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AliasingBug.html).

   >  So if we want changes to be shared, we need to handle that as the exception rather than the rule.
   
* [Value Objects should be immutable to avoid aliasing bugs](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html). 

   > Objects that are equal due to the value of their properties are called value objects.
   
### Others

* Google [open source the Embedding Projector for visualizing high dimensional data](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/12/open-sourcing-embedding-projector-tool.html).

* Do you know [how to write a git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)? The author gives seven rules of a great a git commit message.

* Apache HBase is built on HDFS. Theoretically, it could be ported to other Hadoop File Systems or general distributed file systems. [FINRA migrated to HBase on EMR using S3 for storage and have lowered their costs by 60%](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/big-data/low-latency-access-on-trillions-of-records-finras-architecture-using-apache-hbase-on-amazon-emr-with-amazon-s3/). 

* [How To Make Your Database 200x Faster Without Having To Pay More?](http://highscalability.com/blog/2016/11/28/how-to-make-your-database-200x-faster-without-having-to-pay.html). The key is returning 99.9%-accurate answers for low-priority queries, and 100% for the rest, or Approximate Query Processing. Some proposals are [BlinkDB](http://blinkdb.org/) and [SnappyData](http://www.snappydata.io/).
