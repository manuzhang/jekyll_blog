title: Weekly Reading 0x6
---

I should apologize (to my self, at least) for that I skipped the weekly reading last week. I gave a [sharing on Gearpump](http://www.slideshare.net/manuzhang/apache-gearpump-lightweight-runtime-streaming-engine) at 5th Nanjing Big Data Tech Meetup on Saturday and I'd been busy preparing materials the week before. The only news that caught my eyes was [Inside Palantir, Silicon Valleyâ€™s Most Secretive Company](https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/inside-palantir-silicon-valleys-most-secretive-company?utm_term=.onev4ekN6#.ihn1Q23KP) on Palantir's grow-up struggles. I was not convinced since losing customers could happen to any startups. Now please read [The Real Lesson for Data Science That is Demonstrated by Palantir's Struggles](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/05/11/palantir-struggles/). Sold? 

Let's get down to this week's readings.  


### Streaming 

* [Apache Kafka 0.10 and Confluent Platform 3.0 is announced](http://www.confluent.io/blog/announcing-apache-kafka-0.10-and-confluent-platform-3.0). Highlights of Kafka 0.10
   - Kafka Streams available
   - Rack awareness so that replicas are guaranteed to span multiple racks or available zones
   - Timestamps in messages indicates the time message produced
   - Kafka Consumer max records

   More on Kafka Streams. Unlike other distributed streaming engines (e.g. Storm, Spark Streaming), a Kafka Streams instance (program) is simply a Java process which is run on one ore more threads. 
   
   > Kafka Streams applications can run on YARN, be deployed on Mesos, run in Docker containers, or just embedded into existing Java applications.
    
* [Twitter just open sourced Heron](https://blog.twitter.com/2016/open-sourcing-twitter-heron), the successor to Storm as real-time stream processing engine at Twitter. It provides backward compatibility with Storm's Topology API. Please go to their [website](http://heronstreaming.io/) for more information
   
* Microsoft published a new paper [StreamScope: Continuous Reliable Distributed Processing of Big Data Streams](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/24/streamscope-continuous-reliable-distributed-processing-of-big-data-streams/) in NSDI '16. After a quick glance, they didn't go beyond *watermark*.

### Spark

* [Spark has implemented approximate Algorithms. HyperLogLog and Quantiles in 2.0 ](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/19/approximate-algorithms-in-apache-spark-hyperloglog-and-quantiles.html).

### Others 

* Julia Evans [shared some advice on writing blog posts](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/).        
   
   > I really like writing short blog posts because I have a short attention span and I find short blog posts easier to digest when other people write them.

Yes, blogging should never burden you or your readers down. That's it.
