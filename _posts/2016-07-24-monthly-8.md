title: Monthly Reading 0x8
---

Okay, the *Weekly Reading* has finally embarrassingly turned into *Monthly Reading*. I leave the id auto-incremented to *0x8*.


### Streaming

* We introduced Kafka Streams about [2 months ago](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/05/29/weekly-6.html) but haven't talked about [how does it fit the stream processing landscape?](https://softwaremill.com/kafka-streams-how-does-it-fit-stream-landscape/). My two cents is that you get full functionality of stream processing without adding/maintaining another system if Kafka is already used. It makes much sense since the premise holds in many cases. What's different on Kafka Streams ? Michael Noll from [Confluent](http://www.confluent.io/) wrote a series about its unique features.
    - [Elastic Scaling in Kafka Streams](http://www.confluent.io/blog/elastic-scaling-in-kafka-streams)
    - [Secure Streaming Processing with Kafka Streams](http://www.confluent.io/blog/secure-stream-processing-with-kafka-streams)

* SQL on streaming has divided into two worlds. One is [Spark SQL over Structured Streaming](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/11/apache-spark-2-0-technical-preview-easier-faster-and-smarter.html). The other is [StreamingSQL](http://www.slideshare.net/julianhyde/streaming-sql) from [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/), which is being integrated by Storm, Flink and Samza for their SQL layers. 

* Another buzzword is IoT Analytics (with streaming). Storm PMC Taylor Goetz shared about this topic in [Beyond the Tweeting Toaster: IoT Analytics with Apache Storm, Kafka and Arduino](https://speakerdeck.com/ptgoetz/beyond-the-tweeting-toaster-iot-analytics-with-apache-storm-kafka-and-arduino). This is, however, one-way flow of `sensor -> connector -> kafka -> storm`.

* Spotify runs its services on Google Compute Engine and adopts Google Cloud Dataflow for data processing work. They've implemented a [Scala DSL](https://github.com/spotify/scio) on top of Dataflow SDK which is now [being moved into Apache Beam](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-302). Check it out at [Handling Streaming Data in Spotify Using the Cloud](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/spotify-streaming-cloud).

### Machine Learning

* Edo Liberty, head of Yahoo's Independent Research in New York, [introduced basic concepts in online machine learning](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/data-mining-machine-learning) and Yahoo's [DataSketches library](http://datasketches.github.io/).

### Distributed Systems

* Aysylu Greenberg discussed [patterns in distributed systems](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-systems-patterns) from systems she has worked at Google.

  * Robust & scaleable pipelines
  * Leases for sharing & heartbeat
  * Trade off inaccuracy for
resilience & performance 

### Apache Spark 

* [Apache Spark Key Terms Explained](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/06/22/apache-spark-key-terms-explained.html) covers all the major concepts in Spark from APIs to components.

* Speaking of API, have you ever wondered what the relationship is between Spark's three APIs: RDD, DataFrame and Dataset? Now here is [A Tale of Three Apache Spark APIs: RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html).

* Spark Summit 2016 took place from June 6 to June 8 in San Francisco. In [Spark Summit 2016 Review](http://datascienceassn.org/content/spark-summit-2016-review) Michael Malak said 
   
   > Spark might have been overhyped during the 1.x days, but with Spark 2.0 it's caught up to the hype generated during the 1.0 days.
    
### Scala & Java

* If you've been puzzled by Scala compiler errors and don't know what to do next, [Scala Clippy](https://scala-clippy.org/), which adds helpful messages, might be the right compiler plugin for you.

* [Stackoverflow: 7 of the Best Java Answers That You Havenâ€™t Seen](http://blog.takipi.com/stackoverflow-7-of-the-best-java-answers-that-you-havent-seen/) is a summary by Takipi on most interesting Java Q&A on Stackoverflow.

### Others

* Stackoverflow has an 34 min outage on July 20. From the official [Outage Postmortem](http://stackstatus.net/post/147710624694/outage-postmortem-july-20-2016),
    
     > The direct cause was a malformed post that caused one of our regular expressions to consume high CPU on our web servers. 

* Nathan Marz questioned the practice of recruiting in [The limited value of a computer science education](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/the-limited-value-of-a-computer-science-education.html). 

     > Whether someone can or cannot solve some cute algorithm problem in a high-pressure situation tells you nothing about that person's ability to write solid, clean, well-structured programs in normal working conditions.
     
  He said take-home projects is a better alternative. Yes, I agree and I asked the interviewers to give a brief presentation on one of [awesome-bigdata](https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata) lists last time.
