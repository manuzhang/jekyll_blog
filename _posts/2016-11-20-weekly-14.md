Last week, [Apache Big Data Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-europe) was held in Seville, Spain from Nov.14th to Nov.16th. The conference was full of great contents from Apache Big Data projects. My colleagues Karol and Huafeng  co-presented [Apache Gearpump Next-Gen Streaming Engine](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/Apache%20Gearpump%20-%2016-9.pdf) with the use case of Gearpump-on-[TAP](http://trustedanalytics.org/) and latest performance data. Huafeng also [gave a report comparing modern stream processing engines on functionalities and performances](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/Streaming%20Report.pdf]).  I will write more about my takes here after going through the slides.


### Releases

* [Apache Spark 2.0.2](http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-0-2.html) has been released containing stability fixes. All 2.0.x users are strongly recommended to upgrade. Kafka 0.10 and runtime metrics have been added for Structured Streaming. 	

### Kafka

Kafka made up a large part of my readings last week.

* Anil Kumar from WalmartLabs wrote about how Kafka has decentralized autonomous services and enabled agile development in [Apache Kafka for Item Setup](https://medium.com/walmartlabs/apache-kafka-for-item-setup-3fe8f4ba5967#.8bj3haxas).

* Confluent [announced Interactive Queries for Kafka Streams](https://www.confluent.io/blog/unifying-stream-processing-and-interactive-queries-in-apache-kafka/). The queryable states are stored in embedded databases like [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/). Under the hood, each Kafka Streams instance exposes its metadata which a developer could obtain for a given store name and key through Interactive Query APIs. There is no built-in RPC layer for distributed querying but Confluent provides a [reference REST-based implementation](REST-based implementation). 

* Confluent also [walked through their contributions to Kafka Client Ecosystem](https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-contributions-to-the-apache-kafka-client-ecosystem). Besides the Java client, they have focused on making high quality C client and wrap C client for clients in other languages. 

* Kafka Streams is a lightweight library and has no built-in scheduler or cluster support. How can it be scaled ? [Kafka Streams - Scaling up or down](http://aseigneurin.github.io/2016/10/07/kafka-streams-scaling-up-or-down.html) explains it with a simple example.

* The scaling of Kafka Streams is built on Kafka's consumer group and its rebalancing feature. Here is article to hep you [understand Kafka consumer groups](https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-kafka-consumer-groups-and-consumer-l).

### Deep Learning and AI

* What Artificial Intelligence Can and Can’t Do Right Now ? Andrew Ng gives his [answers](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now).
   
  - What AI can do ?                  
    > If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.
 
  - What AI can't do ?
    > AI work requires carefully choosing A and B and providing the necessary data to help the AI figure out the A→B relationship. 
    
      A is the input and B is the response.  The necessary data means a huge amount of data which Andrew calls Achilles' heel in today's supervised learning software.
      
* Algorithmia shared about their [lessons learned in deploying deep learning at scale](http://blog.algorithmia.com/deploying-deep-learning-cloud-services/). They find the cloud is in its infancy to deploy models into production.

That's all for this week. Happy Reading !
