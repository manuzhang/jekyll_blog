title: Biweekly Reading 0x10
--- 


It's 2017 and I'm still struggling with my procrastination. The [last reading](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/12/11/triweekly-15.html) was more than a month ago and articles have been piling up in my Pocket list. Not to overburden and scare off myself from this routine, I'd like to just do a biweekly reading to start again. Another reason is the value of news decay quickly as the value of data. I'll start with open source releases.

### Releases

* [Google announced the public beta for Cloud Spanner: a global database service for mission-critical applications](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/02/introducing-Cloud-Spanner-a-global-database-service-for-mission-critical-applications.html). People have been discussing whether it beats the CAP theorem. Eric Brewer, the author of CAP and VP of Google Cloud [shared his idea](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/02/inside-Cloud-Spanner-and-the-CAP-Theorem.html). Spanner is technically a CP system while providing more than five 9s of available in practice. It is achieved through Google's private network.
  
  > Google controls the entire network and thus can ensure redundancy of hardware and paths, and can also control upgrades and operations in general. 


* [Apache Flink made 1.2.0 major release](http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/02/06/release-1.2.0.html) with a bunch of new features
    - supports changing the parallelism of a streaming job by restoring it from a savepoint with a different parallelism.
    - redistribution of kafka partitions and offsets among consumers
    - async I/O operator
    - queryable state
    - allows user to restart from a 1.1.4 savepoint 
    - enhanced Table API & SQL (e.g. window aggregations over streaming tables)
   
* [Apache Storm released 1.0.3](http://storm.apache.org/2017/02/14/storm103-released.html) as a maintenance release, to be followed by 1.1.0 soon. 

* [Akka 2.4.17 released with security patch](http://akka.io/news/2017/02/10/akka-2.4.17-released.html) for a potential security issue with Java deserialization.

* [Databricks blog gives highlights and tutorial](https://databricks.com/blog/2017/02/09/intels-bigdl-databricks.html) of Intel's recently released [BigDL](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL) project. BigDL will sit on the same level as Structured Streaming, MLLib and GraphX in the Spark Stack.

* [Intel and Cloudera have collaborated to speed up Spark’s ML algorithms, via integration with Intel’s Math Kernel Library](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2017/02/accelerating-apache-spark-mllib-with-intel-math-kernel-library-intel-mkl/). Benchmark results show performance boost against JVM based execution and [OpenBLAS](http://www.openblas.net/)

### Conferences

* [Recap of Machine Learning @Scale 2017](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1692857177682119/machine-learning-scale-2017-recap) is posted on [Facebook Code blog](https://code.facebook.com/). For those not familiar with this conference like me

  > Machine Learning @Scale is an invitation-only technical conference for data scientists, engineers and researchers working on large-scale applied machine learning solutions

* [Keynotes and highlights](https://databricks.com/blog/2017/02/09/spark-summit-east-2017-another-record-setting-spark-summit.html) from Databricks' speakers at [Spark Summit East 2017](https://spark-summit.org/east-2017/schedule/) (with videos and slides) are available on their official blog. For users blocked from YouTube, check out [this link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jHD7yey).

### Industry

* [Confluent Grows Subscriptions by Over 700 Percent in 2016 as Businesses Seize the Power of Real-Time Data](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170201005431/en/Confluent-Grows-Subscriptions-700-Percent-2016-Businesses). Confluent Enterprise product is built around Apache Kafka™, including [Control Center](https://www.confluent.io/product/control-center/) to manage Kafka at scale, [Kafka Connector API](https://www.confluent.io/product/connectors/) to connect with other systems and [Kafka Streams API](https://www.confluent.io/product/kafka-streams/) for lightweight stream processing. Kafka in Big Data is similar to pipe `|` in Unix.

* [Hortonworks reports record 2016 revenue of 184.5 million and 52.0 fourth quarter revenue](http://hortonworks.com/press-releases/hortonworks-reports-record-2016-revenue-184-5-million-fourth-quarter-revenue-52-0-million/). 

* [Evernote migrates to Google Gloud Platform](https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2017/02/08/evernote-reaches-the-cloud) with 5 billion notes and 5 billion attachments, or over 3 petabytes data.


### Programming

* [What's Functional Programming All About?](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html) Li haoyi gives his answer as

  > The core of Functional Programming is thinking about data-flow rather than control-flow

  He has written a lot of worth-reading [articles](http://www.lihaoyi.com/) as well as high-profile [tools](https://github.com/lihaoyi).

### Streaming

* Stateful processing has been added to Apache Beam, the unified model of batch and streaming. [Here is a nice guide to walk you through the new feature](https://beam.apache.org/blog/2017/02/13/stateful-processing.html).

That's all for the first reading in 2017.   I'd like to **write more posts** this year, and **beyond weekly reading**. Let's see if I can win the battle against procrastination.
