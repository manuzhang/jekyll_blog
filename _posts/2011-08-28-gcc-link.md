title: GCC link
---

Last term, our OS teacher asked us to write a library file ourselves and try to link it. I tried it out on Windows NT but it didn't work out. And I came across it again in the book Expert C Programming. The book is back in 1990s so the solution it provides is already obsolete. Thus, I look it up online and with some experiment here's what I've got.

## Source files:

```c
/* main.c */

#include "calc_mean.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  double v1, v2, m;
  v1 = 5.2;
  v2 = 7.9;
  m  = mean(v1, v2);
  printf("The mean of %3.2f and %3.2f is %3.2fn", v1, v2, m);
  return 0;
}

```

```c
/* calc_mean.h */

double mean(double a, double b);
```

```c
/* calc_mean.c */

double mean(double a, double b)
{
  return (a + b) / 2;
}
```

##I. Statically linked

Firstly, generate an object file (calc_mean.c is no longer needed from now on)

```bash
cc -c calc_mean.c -o calc_mean.o
```

Then the archiver(ar) is invoked to produce a static library mean.a

```bash
ar rcs libmean.a calc_mean.o
```

linking against static library

```bash
cc -static main.c -L. -lmean -o statically_linked
```

run

```bash
./statically_linked
```

This is exactly what the first reference says, but the dynamically linking solution seems not to be useful so I have my own version with the help of both

##II. Dynamicall linked

As with static libraries, an object file is created.

```bash
cc -c -fPIC calc_mean.c -o calc_mean.o
```

Also we need to compile main.c with calc_mean.h (calc_mean.c is no longer needed and we'd better delete it)

```bash
cc -c main.c -o main.o
```

link object files into a shared library mean.so

```bash
cc -shared -o libmean.so calc_mean.o
```

linking agaings dynamica library

```bash
cc -o dynamically_linked main.o -L. -lmean
```

run with the load path

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
./dynamically_linked
```

As for the meanings of all the options, manpage is the best reference and tutorial.
