title: Monthly Reading 0x9
---

It's almost another month. In the early August, I attended [Strata + Hadoop World Beijing](http://strata.oreilly.com.cn/hadoop-big-data-cn), the first ever Strata in China, and shared about [Apache Gearpump next-gen streaming engine](http://www.slideshare.net/manuzhang/apache-gearpump-nextgen-streaming-engine). Following that, Apache Gearpump (incubating) made its first Apache release. Meanwhile, Apache Spark, Apache Storm and Akka also released new versions.

### Release

* [Databricks has introduced Apache Spark 2.0](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/26/introducing-apache-spark-2-0.html). Most eye-catching new features are
  
  - expanded SQL Support (including all 99 TPC-DS query)
  - unified DataFrames and Datasets API in Scala/Java
  - A single entry point `SparkSession` subsuming both `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`
  - whole-stage code generation that makes Spark 10X faster
  - Structured Streaming (Learn more about the feature at [Structured Streaming in Apache Spark](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/28/structured-streaming-in-apache-spark.html) and [Continuous Applications: Evolving Streaming in Apache Spark 2.0](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/28/continuous-applications-evolving-streaming-in-apache-spark-2-0.html))

* [Apache Storm 1.0.2 has released](https://storm.apache.org/2016/08/10/storm102-released.html) fixing bugs, improving performance, stability and fault tolerance. One thing to note is [Backpressure can cause spout to stop emitting and stall topology](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1949) and [is disabled by default](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1956).

* [Akka 2.4.9 is available](http://akka.io/news/2016/08/19/akka-2.4.9-released.html) with improved performance on Akka HTTP and Akka Streams. Akka HTTP performance is on-par or better than Spray.

### Streaming 

* Yelp has a series covering its real-time streaming data infrastructure.
  - [Billions of Messages a Day - Yelp's Real-time Data Pipeline](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/07/billions-of-messages-a-day-yelps-real-time-data-pipeline.html)
  - [Streaming MySQL tables in real-time to Kafka](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/08/streaming-mysql-tables-in-real-time-to-kafka.html)
  - [More Than Just a Schema Store](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/08/more-than-just-a-schema-store.html)
* [LINE is applying Kafka Streams for internal message delivery pipeline](http://developers.linecorp.com/blog/?p=3960). If you are looking for a thin streaming layer (without execution framework, resource scheduler, etc) that works best with Kafka, Kafka Streams could be the right choice. 
* [Writing SQL on Streaming Data with Amazon Kinesis Analytics â€“ Part 1](http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/bigdata/post/Tx2D4GLDJXPKHOY/Writing-SQL-on-Streaming-Data-with-Amazon-Kinesis-Analytics-Part-1) provides an overview of streaming analytics on AWS. 

### Scala

* [Martin Odersky outlined significant plans for Scala after a quiet 2015](https://www.lightbend.com/company/news/after-a-quiet-2015-martin-odersky-outlined-significant-plans-for-scala-at-scala-days-new-york)
  - The Scala Center
  - Scala 2.12
  - Plans to rethink the Scala libraries
  - Development of new target platforms
  - DOT and Dotty

* A related news is [Samsung SAMI team enabled live IoT data pipeling with Akka and reactive architecture](https://www.lightbend.com/company/news/after-a-quiet-2015-martin-odersky-outlined-significant-plans-for-scala-at-scala-days-new-york)

* Speaking of reactive, Akka Streams is an implementation of [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) where back pressure is the key. [Simply explained: Akka Streams Backpressure]( http://chariotsolutions.com/blog/post/simply-explained-akka-streams-backpressure/) walks through an example to illustrate what back pressure is.

* If you are building applications on Akka or with [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config), [Effective Typesafe Config](http://www.janvsmachine.net/2016/07/effective-typesafe-config.html) is a handy guide.

### Java

* Oracle Java Architect, [Brian Goetz](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/lessons-java-evolution) looks at lessons of Java evolution and where Java platform is headed.

* For Java applications to work, dependencies must be present on the classpath. We usually build fat jars with all dependencies using maven-assembly-plugin or maven-shade-plugin. Deploying a fat every time could be slow and inefficient while [a better way is to upload dependencies to a distributed file system for once individually](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/the-fault-in-our-jars-why-we-stopped-building-fat-jars). 

That's it for last month. Wish I could return to my weekly timeline.
