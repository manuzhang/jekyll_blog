title: Weekly Reading 0x7
---

So long since last time that the "Weekly Reading" is almost becoming "Monthly Reading". It is a (bad) sign that I haven't read much these days. One thing I've been up to is the upcoming [Shanghai BigData Streaming 3rd Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-Big-Data-Streaming-Meetup/events/231831396/). Let's chat on Big Data Streaming and European Cups over a cup of beer. Another is the [Gearpump Runner](https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/pull/323) for [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org). The reading list is also of good contents on Streaming and Apache Beam / Google Cloud Dataflow. 

### Streaming


* We firstly introduced [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org) in [week 4](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/05/08/weekly-4.html) and then looked at [Google's](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/05/15/weekly-5.html) and [dataArtisans's](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/05/29/weekly-6.html) perspectives. [Future-proof and scale-proof your code](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/future-proof-and-scale-proof-your-code) gives another two reasons to use Apache Beam.
 
   - Future-proofing
     
     > Future-proofing code means that we’ll be able to run it on new technologies as they come out, without having to re-write the code.
    
   - Scale-proofing
  
     > As data grows, “scale-proofing” code means that we can start out with small data, and have an API that grows with us.
     
  I think, with Apache Beam, it's cheap to try out another platform and carry out benchmarking. Plus, there will be no difference between writing codes run on single machine and cloud.
  
  
* This is how wordcount looks like with Beam API. Each `apply` function takes a `PTransform` parameter, like `ParDo` and `Count`.

  ```java
  Pipeline p = Pipeline.create(options);
  p.apply(ParDo.named("ExtractWords").of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
                      @Override
                      public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
                        for (String word : c.element().split("[^a-zA-Z']+")) {
                          if (!word.isEmpty()) {
                            c.output(word);
                          }
                        }
                      }
                    }))
   .apply(Count.<String>perElement())                 
   .apply(TextIO.Write.to("gs://YOUR_OUTPUT_BUCKET/AND_OUTPUT_PREFIX"));
  p.run();
  ```

  Beam is inspired by [FlumeJava](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub35650.html)   but it has replaced FlumeJava's methods on `PCollection` with the ubiquitous `PTransform`. [Where's my `PCollection.map()`?](http://beam.incubator.apache.org/blog/2016/05/27/where-is-my-pcollection-dot-map.html) looks at the history and design decisions behind this. 
  
* Besides Apache Beam, Google Cloud Dataflow offers two advanced features  
   
  - [Autoscaling](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/03/comparing-cloud-dataflow-autoscaling-to-spark-and-hadoop) dynamically adjusts the number of workers to the needs of pipeline. It is especially useful for streaming application where input data rate varies over time. 
  - [Liquid Sharding](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/05/no-shard-left-behind-dynamic-work-rebalancing-in-google-cloud-dataflow) addresses the problems of stragglers through asking busy workers to give away unprocessed work to free workers.

  
* [Reactive Kafka](https://github.com/akka/reactive-kafka) is an [Akka Streams](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.6/scala/stream/index.html) connector for [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org). Check out [Reducing Microservice Complexity with Kafka and Reactive Streams](http://www.slideshare.net/jimriecken/reducing-microservice-complexity-with-kafka-and-reactive-streams) for examples. 

### Scala

* [Li Haoyi demonstrates how to micro-optimize your Scala code](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/MicrooptimizingyourScalacode.html), which is full of useful techniques.

### Beyond 

* How to solve hard programing problems ? Julia Evans comes up with [three ways](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/29/three-ways-to-solve-hard-programming-problems/).

  - Realize that there is awesome existing software that you can repurpose
  - Steal an idea 
  - Come up with a new idea

* [Intel x86s hide another CPU that can take over your machine (you can't audit it)](http://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html). Take it with a grain of salt.

That's all for this week. See you in the meetup.
