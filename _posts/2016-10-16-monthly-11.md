It seems everyone in Big Data is doing Weekly / Bi-weekly / Monthly review. Here is my subscription list

* [Hadoop Weekly](https://www.hadoopweekly.com/) by [Joe Crobak](https://twitter.com/joecrobak) (Weekly)
* [This week in #Scala](http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/this-week-in-scala-10/10/2016) by CakeSolutions (Weekly)
* [Log Compaction - Highlights in the Apache Kafka and Stream Processing Community](http://www.confluent.io/blog/log-compaction-highlights-apache-kafka-stream-processing-community-september-2016/) by Confluent (Monthly)
* [Databricks Bi-Weekly Apache Spark Digest](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/10/04/databricks-bi-weekly-apache-spark-digest-10316.html) by Databricks (Bi-Weekly)
* [Lightbend Tech Digest](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/lightbend-tech-digest-september-2016) by Lightbend (Monthly)
* [Montly Review](http://data-artisans.com/sept-2016-in-review/) by dataArtisans (Monthly)

Now I'm writing up a review based on reviews.

### Releases

A bunch of maintenace releases from the open source community.

* [Apache Storm made a maintenance release 0.10.2 for 0.10](https://storm.apache.org/2016/09/14/storm0102-released.html).
* [Apache Flink released 1.1.3](http://flink.apache.org/news/2016/10/12/release-1.1.3.html), bugfix release for 1.1 series. RocksDB state backend users are recommended to use the "fully async" mode such that upgrade to 1.2 will be easier. 
* [Apache Spark also made a maintenance release 2.0.1](http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-0-1.html) containing 300 stability and bug fixes. 
* Apache Calcite released [1.10.0](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/history.html#v1-10-0) and [1.9.0](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/history.html#v1-9-0), and mainly improved Druid Adapter. 

### Conferences

* [Flink Forward 2016](http://flink-forward.org/thank-you/#more-1037) was held from Sep.12th to Sep.14th with 350 attendees and over 40 speakers. Videos and slides for all [sessions](http://flink-forward.org/program/sessions/) are available now. After a quick glance through, I come up with this list of mainly technical talks which nicely capture the current status and next steps of Flink.

    - [Connecting Apache Flink to the World: Reviewing the streaming connectors](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/connecting-apache-flink-with-the-world-reviewing-the-streaming-connectors/)
    - [Declarative stream processing with StreamSQL and CEP](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/declarative-stream-processing-with-streamsql-and-cep/)
    - [Dynamic scaling: How Apache Flink adapts to changing workloads](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/dynamic-scaling-how-apache-flink-adapts-to-changing-workloads/)
    - [Running Apache Flink everywhere: Standalone, Yarn, Mesos, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/running-apache-flink-everywhere-standalone-yarn-mesos-docker-kubernetes-etc/)
    - [Scaling Stream Processing with Apache Flink to very large State](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/scaling-stream-processing-with-apache-flink-to-very-large-state/)
    - [Streaming ML with Flink
](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/streaming-ml-with-flink/)
    - [Taking a look under the hood of Apache Flink’s relational APIs](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/taking-a-look-under-the-hood-of-apache-flinks-relational-apis/)
    - [The Future of Apache Flink](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/the-future-of-apache-flinktm/)

* [Reactive Summit 2016](https://www.reactivesummit.org/), the first ever Reactive Summit, took place Oct.4 - Oct.5 in Austin. All talks are now [available](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChUrUs_xAW2YiSV7iBWkzhw/videos). I haven't gone through the topics but [Implementing an akka-streams materializer for big data](http://sched.co/7jeY) by our [Kam](https://twitter.com/kkasravi) is definitely worth checking out.

### Articles

* [7-big-data-tools-to-ditch-in-2017](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3128344/analytics/7-big-data-tools-to-ditch-in-2017.html). Both MapReduce and its streaming counterpart Storm make the list. Wait, are you sure to ditch Java ?

* [Scalable Stream Processing: A Survey of Storm, Samza, Spark and Flink](https://medium.baqend.com/real-time-stream-processors-a-survey-and-decision-guidance-6d248f692056#.ws1mi2eb9) 

    > give an overview over the state of the art of stream processors for low-latency Big Data analytics and conduct a qualitative comparison of the most popular contenders

* 4-min read on [How Kafka’s Storage Internals Work](https://medium.com/the-hoard/how-kafkas-storage-internals-work-3a29b02e026#.gwuov9szg). A big fan of such short informative stories.

* Jay Kreps has a new masterpiece, [Sharing is Caring: Multi-tenancy in Distributed Data Systems](http://www.confluent.io/blog/sharing-is-caring-multi-tenancy-in-distributed-data-systems) 

    > You see hundreds of blog posts on benchmarking infrastructure systems—showing millions of requests per second on vast clusters—but far fewer about the work of scaling a system to hundreds or thousands of engineers and use cases. It’s just a lot harder to quantify multi-tenancy than it is to quantify scalability.
    
  Can't agree more ! A multi-tenancy benchmark, anyone ? I'll leave you here to think more about this topic.
