title: Weekly Reading 0x11
--- 

Last week, we mentioned [announcement of Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/02/introducing-Cloud-Spanner-a-global-database-service-for-mission-critical-applications.html). There is an "open source version", [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), built by three ex-Googlers who also founded a company around it. We would read about how [Google Spanner Inspires CockroachDB To Outrun It](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/02/22/google-spanner-inspires-cockroachdb-outrun/) this week.  

Without Google's private network and atomic clock, CockroachDB provides serializer isolation, weaker than Spanner's linearizable isolation. CockRoachDB is based on [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) using [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd)([Raft](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)) for consensus. It has compatible interface with Postgres, supporting most SQL 92, some SQL 2011 and Spanner functions. They've employed [jepsen for consistency analysis](http://jepsen.io/analyses/cockroachdb-beta-20160829) and found bugs leading to serializability violations. The software is still in beta at the time of writing. Let's see how it will turn out. 

Now, what else ?

### Releases

* [Apache Samza 0.12.0 has been released](https://blogs.apache.org/samza/entry/announcing-the-release-of-apache) with the support of both unbounded and bounded sources, or "Convergence of Batch and Real-time processing" as said.

* [Apache Kafka has made a feature release 0.10.2.0](https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/0.10.2.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html) which includes the completion of 15 KIPs, over 200 bug fixes and improvements. Among them are supports for session windows and global table in Kafka Streams.

### Docker

* We [talked about Unikernel](http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/01/28/unikernel.html) one year ago, which can only be run on Xen hypervisor then. Now [the Unikernel operating system MirageOS supports the KVM hypervisor](http://www.eweek.com/cloud/mirageos-unikernel-effort-moves-forward.html). MirageOS components have been used to [enable native Docker on macOS and Windows](http://www.eweek.com/virtualization/docker-goes-native-for-windows-and-mac.html) instead of running on VirtualBox.

### Google

* Sharing our experiences with Virtual Reality(VR) can't be difficult, and that's where [Mixed Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAFpA1AGs4E)(MR) comes in. With MR, we can see the virtual environment of a VR user except the facial expressions blocked by the headset. Now Google researchers have been [working on a solution to "remove" the headset](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/02/headset-removal-for-virtual-and-mixed.html). 

* Preprocessing is required to apply machine learning to real world datasets, which can be done *separately* through a large scale data processing framework such as [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org/). Now Google [announced tf.Transform to make it part of a TensorFlow graph](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/02/preprocessing-for-machine-learning-with.html). That is achieved through [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/)  whose applications can be run on Spark, Flink and Google's own [Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow).

* A piece of "old" news from Google, [Announcing TensorFlow Fold: Deep Learning With Dynamic Computation Graphs](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-tensorflow-fold-deep.html). TensorFlow Fold is to address challenge that data of varying size and structure don't batch together. You may read their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02181) for more details.

### Security

* Google [has found the first SHA1 collision](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html).

  > The attacker could then use this collision to deceive systems that rely on hashes into accepting a malicious file in place of its benign counterpart. For example, two insurance contracts with drastically different terms.

  Here is [an interesting site showing lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions](cryptographic hash functions).
  
* The other breaking news is [CloudBleed](https://medium.com/@octal/cloudbleed-how-to-deal-with-it-150e907fd165#.qn9jsos51)
 
  > Essentially, web requests to Cloudflare-backed sites received answers which included random information from other Cloudflare-backed sites!
  
  Here is [a list of possibly affected domains](https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare).

* Dropbox have [open sourced Securitybot](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/02/meet-securitybot-open-sourcing-automated-security-at-scale/), to "automatically confirm and aggregate suspicious behavior with employees on a distributed scale".

That's all for the week. Super happy to keep up the momentum.
